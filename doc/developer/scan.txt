Pre-requisites
==============




Relevant code files
===================

The implementation of scan is spread over several files. The different
files, and section of the code they deal with, are :

* ``scan.py`` implements the ``scan`` function. The ``scan`` function
  arranges the arguments of scan correctly, constructs the scan op and
  afterwards calls the constructed scan op on the arguments. This function
  takes care of figuring out missing inputs and shared variables. 

* ``scan_op.py`` implements the ``Scan`` Op class. The ``Scan`` respects
  the ``Op`` interface, and contains most of the logic of the scan operator.

* ``scan_utils.py`` contains several helpful functions used through out the
  other files that are specific of the scan operator.

* ``scan_views.py`` contains different views of the scan op that have
  simpler and easier signatures to be used in specific cases.

* ``scan_opt.py`` contains the list of all optimizations for the scan
  operator.
